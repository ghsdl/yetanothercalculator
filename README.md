React.js

# figma design

I made a design for this project so i will try to make it into CSS :) [Yet Another Calculator](https://www.figma.com/file/6NHmKZS4Xauvyz6CR1HP96/YetAnotherCalculator?node-id=0%3A1).

# what i thought would happen 

Struggling from the get go with layout and architecture
Struggling with functions
Struggling with wording of the components
Enjoying CSS
Enjoying the result 
Having fun coding on my own

# what actually happened 
I did struggle with architecture and i'm still not satisfied
I did enjoy turning my design into CSS (though i think it's not modern i like the 80s vibe)
I did struggle with the functions but once i got the hang of it, it turned out quite fun 

# what i learned from this project 

I enjoyed more than i thought playing with maths
Manipulating state is quite easy once you understand how it works especially with setState
I love coding on my own 
React is powerful and props are automagic stuff
